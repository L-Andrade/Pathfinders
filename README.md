## Work in progress

This is an app that helps admins track activities with participants.

An admin can also specify each activity's criteria and evaluate each participant accordingly.

This serves a real-life purpose, while also allowing me to test out new things. 
It is far from perfect but I've learned a few things while developing it.
There are many improvements that can be made, and will hopefully be done eventually.

The Google Services files are not published in this repository.
